# Feature-Extraction-and-Selection-of-Sentinel-1
This repo contains codes and methods used in "Feature Extraction and Selection of Sentinel-1 Dual-Pol Data for Global-Scale Local Climate Zone Classification". Due to the size of data is too large, this repo works with one city for an example.

## Softwares
The data processing relies on ESA toolbox [SNAP](https://step.esa.int/main/download/snap-download/). Experiments uses Matlab

## Data processing
The data processing relies on SNAP. The following flowchart demonstrates the data processing scheme.
